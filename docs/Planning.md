# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
Bristol City Council allow for open data to be accessed about **Recycling Banks**. We will be using this open data to allow for the public to find and locate the closest Recycling Banks with certan criteria.

### Business benefits
- Efficient in locating the Banks and specifying criteria to fit the client
- For other Businesses, they can add Recycling Banks seeing the data on how many people recycle in that said area
- Creates traffic towards businesses and also allows for a multi-purpose visit, for example: Recycling just before you shop.
- 

### Options Considered: 
- Weekly bin collection from the Council.
- Using normal bins that don't allow recycling which is worse for the environment.
- Littering.
- Using Google and Apple Maps.

### Expected Risks:
- Waste of resources as certain people won't use it.
- Data set may not be kept updated.
- Out of order bin.
- Not cleaned or cleared properly. Could lead to infestations.
- Properly trained people may be scarce, could be disposed of wrong.

## Project Scope:

Actors: 
- NPCs, Council / Recycling / Eco-Friendly Publics

Systems: 
- Open Data -> Where our data will be taken from
- Database (Backend) - To present even more data perhaps?
- Map Integration / Google Maps - Allows for a more user friendly experience
- HTML / NodeJS - What we will be using to code up and export import etc.
- Drawings to clarify - Diagrams and Drawings to clarify
